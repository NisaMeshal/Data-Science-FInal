# Data-Science-FInal

This project will analyze my Spotify user data and weather information over the span of July to September of this year. 
I chose this data because I enjoy listening to music and it would be fun to see a breakdown of my information aside from the annual Spotify wrapped. 
Additionally, I chose this so that I could try and spot a pattern from my listening habits. 
The tables of Spotify data include track name, time played, artist, and date played collected from my usage of the app. 
The weather API will return a CSV that contains dates and the weather data for that given date collected by the Spokane weather station. 
In this project, we will only use average daily temperature since most of the other attributes are irrelevant and have many missing values. 
For classification, I will classify the genres of each artist and make predictions upon it.
